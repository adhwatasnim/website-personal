  <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">In the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, when it was just beginning to become clear that people who could stay at home would be doing so for a very long while, I was lazying around, having the time of my life as everything were stopped at place; the work, the university assignments, the class and the pressure. It seems that what I've been asking for my whole life has finally happened; to get a time off and to just do nothing at all. Everything was at peace of mind with no one to bother me at all, well, atleast except for my family members. I was being unproductive at my best, by sleeping late and waking up at noon as I was mocked by my mom for being the princess I am. Being in an asian family, that definitely would not impress anyone around and yet, I do not care at all.</p>
	<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">However, things changed when I finally realized the things that happened throughout the world is indeed serious, and it is not going to stay for short time. This quarantine is realer than I had expected. I started to get anxious and hence, I am currently trying to make a change on my depressing routine as I need to do something just to feel good about myself. The sleeping schedule stays the same, but the day routine is what I just have to change. For all of the time that I've been overthinking alone in my small room, I had missed on what I used to enjoy doing. So, I started my day by working out first thing in the morning as it is the best time to work out with an empty stomach. Combined with the laziness that I still have, the workout would be strictly a good 10 minutes, as well as doing it at night time, precisely at midnight since I'm a night owl nowadays. So, here's a video reference of the workout that I do:</p>

  <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">Other than getting myself into a shape, I started to learn Spanish as well because I have quite grow fond over it after binge-watching some Spanish dramas on Netflix. Ridiculous? Might be, but I'm setting my mind right and strive to be a bilingual woman since I can't cope with Mandarin language that my university has to offer. I know, there goes my level 4 in Mandarin to waste because up to this day I am still unable to speak in perfect sentence of Mandarin. Thanks to the technology advancement in this era, language courses can be easily attain online for free. Hence, I've been spending time talking to myself or just randomly towards my friends in Spanish not knowing when could I make a full use out of it. Perhaps I should find a Spanish husband? Or maybe to finally curse people around in Spanish instead since Sarawakians easily understands local language.</p> 
  <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">The most important aspect of the day, is to watch netflix, of course. Did you know, there's a saying "Netflix & Chill" going around the internet, well, I'm gonna make a full use out of it. Watching series have never been a bore for an introvert like me. There are a lot of series that I had done watching throughout the whole month of quarantine so here's some of the top must watch series.</p>
